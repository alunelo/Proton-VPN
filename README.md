<h1>Proton VPN Configuration</h1>
This project explores the fundamental IT concepts behind VPN technology using Proton VPN. The primary objective was to observe the changes in properties such as IP address, location, ISP (Internet Service Provider) when A PC has no VPN compared when it does have a VPN.


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Computer)
- Remote Desktop
- Proton VPN
- www.whatismyipaddress.com

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Key Observations</h2>

- IP Address Changes – Tracked how the public IP address changed when connecting to different Proton VPN servers worldwide.
- Location Masking – Verified geolocation data before and after VPN connection to analyze how websites and services detect user location.

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>
